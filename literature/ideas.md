### TODO
- implement SVM on data
- make code more modular to apply models on given data
- compare to bayes fo baseline if easy
- convert processed data to csv for Ashraf
- access Ashraf's workstation via ssh (see mail)
- try to access IBEX for bigger computational things
- build up some presentation for the done work
